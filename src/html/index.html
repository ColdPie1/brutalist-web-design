        <p>
          The term <em>brutalism</em>
          is often associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">Brutalist Architecture</a>, however it can apply to other forms of construction, such as web design.  This website explains how.

        <p>
          The term <em>brutalism</em> is derived from the French <em>betón brut</em>, meaning “raw concrete”.  Although most brutalist buildings are made from concrete, we're more interested in the term <em>raw</em>.  Concrete brutalist buildings often reflect back the forms used to make them, and their overall design tends to adhere to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_to_materials">truth to materials</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A website's materials aren't HTML tags, CSS, or JavaScript code.  Rather, they are its content and the context in which it's consumed.  A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact.  A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on <em>content</em>, and prioritization of the website visitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brutalist Web Design is honest about what a website is and what it <em>isn't</em>.  A website is not a magazine, though it might have magazine-like articles.  A website is not an application, although you might use it to purchase products or interact with other people.  A website is not a database, although it might be driven by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          A website is about giving visitors content to enjoy and ways to interact with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design guidelines outlined above—and detailed below—all are in the service of making websites more of what they are and less of what they aren't.  These aren't restrictive rules to produce boring, minimalist websites.  Rather these are a set of priorities that put the visitor to your site—the entire reason your website exists—front and center in all things.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1 class="helvetica f2">Exploring the Guidelines</h1>
        <p>
          Below is a detailed look into each of the guidelines listed above.  As with all artistic constraints while you may find them frustrating, you should also find them inspiring.
        </p>
        <section class="mt4">
          <a name="readable-content">
            <h1 class="helvetica f4">
              Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices.
              <aside class="mt0 fw1 dib f7"><a href="#readable-content">Permalink</a></aside>
            </h1>
            <p>
              Most websites exist to deliver content for you to consume, either words (such as on this site), or images, such as on Pinterest.  To be true to that nature, the content must be readable in all browsers.  Some screens are very large, while others are very small.  Some browsers, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen readers</a>, have no screen at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default, a website that uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#elements">HTML tags as intended</a> and has no custom styling will be readable on all screens and devices. Only the act of explicit design will make the content less readable, though it can certainly make it more.  For example, this website does not use default styles, yet, it is readable on any size screen.
            </p>
          </a>
        </section>
        <section class="mt4">
          <a name="clickables">
            <h1 class="helvetica f4">
              Only hyperlinks and buttons respond to clicks.
              <aside class="mt0 fw1 dib f7"><a href="#clickables">Permalink</a></aside>
            </h1>
            <p>
              A web page is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> document that allows for two primary forms of interaction: navigating a link to another location, and submitting information back to a server.  These functions are performed, respectively, by hyperlinks and buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although JavaScript allows any element to respond to a click, websites are not applications, and the vast majority of websites should have no need to resort to such heroics in order to allow the visitor to navigate or submit data.  Further, clickable areas of a page that are not obviously hyperlinks or buttons can confuse the visitor, causing them to perform unwanted actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To trick or deceive the visitor goes against the nature of a website, which is to deliver information and interact honestly with a visitor.
            </p>
          </a>
        </section>
        <section class="mt4">
          <a name="hyperlinks">
            <h1 class="helvetica f4">
              Hyperlinks are underlined and buttons look like buttons.
              <aside class="mt0 fw1 dib f7"><a href="#hyperlinks">Permalink</a></aside>
            </h1>
            <p>
              As mentioned when <a href="#clickables">discussing clicks</a>, only hyperlinks and buttons should respond to clicks, since this maintains an honest and transparent interaction with a visitor.  To maintain a truth to materials, it follows that the appearance of these elements should also be honest.
            </p>
            <p>
              A hyperlink has no analog in the real world. Convention dictates a hyperlink use an underline to reveal its existence.  Since the underline has no other place in modern typesetting, this convention has been unambiguous since the dawn of the web. There is no clearer indicator of more content than an underlined bit of text on a web page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buttons, however, do have an analog both in the real world and, more importantly, in the computer operating system in which a browser runs.  With no effort, every browser on every operating system renders a button in the idiomatic language of that computer (or should). Here is an example that applies no styling to the submit button:
            </p>
            <figure class="ba pa3">
              <form class="pa3 bg-white black br2">
                <label for="email" class="fw1 helvetica tracked ttu">Enter your Email</label>
                <input class="db w-100 mt1 mb2" type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="e.g. pat@example.com">
                <input type="submit">
              </form>
              <figcaption>
                <p class="f7 i fw1 red ma0"><br>Note: this is not a real form</p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This button is unambiguous, both in its function and its difference from a hyperlink.  Where a link promises more information for the visitor, a button agrees to submit <em>the visitors information</em> to the server.  Hiding this interaction behind a hyperlink or unadorned text betrays the core nature of a website.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said, the default visual appearance of a button is often unpleasant.  Fortunately, many forms indicate button-ness to a visitor, and it's often trivial to style a button to both match the visual language of a site while also looking eminently pressable.  Here is an example of a site using a yellow color scheme and serifed fonts that has an obvious button:
            </p>
            <figure class="ba pa3">
              <form class="pa3 bg-washed-yellow black br2 cf">
                <label for="email" class="b f4 mid-gray baskerville">Enter your Email</label>
                <input class="db w-100" type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="e.g. pat@example.com">
                <input type="submit" class="baskerville fr bg-animate mid-gray hover-bg-light-yellow ba pointer br3 pa2 mt1 bg-yellow">
              </form>
              <figcaption>
                <p class="f7 i fw1 red ma0"><br>Note: this is not a real form</p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Notice also that the form elements are true to themselves.  An operating system has a visual language for collecting input from a visitor, and a Brutalist Web Design stays as close to that as possible.

            </figure>
            <p>
              All browsers have a built-in button called the <em>back button</em>.  This promises to take the visitor to the last thing they saw prior to their most recent mouse click.  On a website that adheres to Brutalist Web Design, the last page they saw is almost always the one where they most-recently clicked a hyperlink.
            </p>
            <p>
              It requires a confluence of design and programming to break this feature of all web browsers, as it works by default even in the face of intense styling.  Although a form submission creates a semantically unclear situation for the back button, standard browsers do the best they can to avoid confusing the visitor (improving this situation <em>is</em> the time to bring design and programming together in service to the visitor).
            </p>
            <p>
              The back button is often the visitor's only escape from a mistake they've made, and it's unfortunately common that going back creates further problems due to a broken back button.

            <p>
              A website is not a book. It affords reading by scrolling, not flipping pages.  When content cannot fit entirely on the screen—and it often can't—browsers allow scrolling the view so that the content can be read at the visitor's pace.  Although extensive content requires sections that should appear on different pages, artificial insertion of pages or willful obfuscation of content to suit advertisers is not in the interest of visitors, and betrays the core nature of what a website is.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default, the content on a page can be scrolled in the visitor's preferred method.  Like the back button, this can only be broken by intentional design and careless implementation.  Advertisers need not suffer from scrollable content, however.

            <p>
              When reading a website, visitors often scroll (as <a href="#scrolling">mentioned above</a>), copy text to cite it, or paste text to submit to the server.  A web browser makes these features available in an idiomatic way, based on the visitor's operating system.  These features must work.
            </p>
            <p>
              That JavaScript allows these core features to be impeded is not a reason to do so. It requires careful programming to remove such features from a website.  Doing so subverts the core nature of a website, creating a visitor-hostile space devoid of comfort and safety.

            <p>
              A web page is not an application or a video game.  It is for content, and so its design must be subservient to that purpose. From this truth all visual styling must follow.  This needn't imply a boring website, nor does it require that all websites look the same.
            </p>
            <aside class="dn db-ns fl helvetica f6 fw3 w-50-ns br2 bg-washed-blue dark-gray pl2 pr2 pt1 pb1 mr3 mt1 mb1 tr">

              <p>
                Web pages don't all need to look the same—they just need to stay true to what they are.
              </p>
            </aside>
            <p>
              For example, unless you are on a small screen, this section has a pull quote with a washed blue background, a different text font, and an emoji!  While this design is certainly decoration, it's not distracting.  It serves that content instead of overshadowing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Excessive decoration reverses the roles, distracting the visitor and hiding the content.  Unrelated content, such as nonsensical links to false stories, also distracts.
            </p>
            <p>
              While you should encourage the visitor to explore other parts of your website, do so in harmony with the page they are on.  Nothing makes less sense that the first bit of content on a page encouraging you to leave immediately to read another story or sign up for a mailing list.  Compelling content will drive engagement, not tricks.

              Websites aren't physical like a book or magazine.  Their contents must be downloaded over a computer network and then rendered in a web browser.  This takes time, and visitors are accustomed to this up to a point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider that the entirety of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen is  <span class="nowrap">708 kilobytes</span>.  To download this much data using a very slow mobile connection would be around one second (try it for yourself by <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt">reading it on Project Gutenberg</a>).  <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is over 200 pages long, and would take <a href="https://www.howlongtoreadthis.com/book_details.php?asin=1503290565">over three hours</a> to read.  Certainly a news article, tweet, or product catalog can be downloaded and rendered in a comparable amount of time to a <em>novel</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that by adhering to the other guidelines, your website will download and render quickly. Since it embraces its nature and leverages its raw materials, it allows the entire system of network, browser, content, and operating system to work together smoothly and efficiently.  Even with decoration, advertising, and some imagery, a website embracing Brutalist Web Design will respect your visitors time, bandwidth, and battery.

          <a href="http://mrmrs.cc">A friend</a> gave me design advice once.  He said to start with left-aligned black text on a white background, and to apply styling only to solve a specific problem.  If you embrace this, you will embrace Brutalist Web Design.  Focus on your content, and your visitors will be happy with your site.  Focus on decoration or tricking your visitors into clicking ads, and your content will suffer, along with your visitors.
